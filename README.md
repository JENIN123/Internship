## ABSTRACT

The idea behind this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data to improve road safety. The key components of the project include:

## Data Analysis

  1.	Accident Hotspot Identification: The code analyses geographical data to pinpoint locations with the highest frequency and severity of accidents. This information can be used to prioritize areas for safety improvements.
   
  2.	Time Pattern Analysis: By examining the distribution of accidents across different hours of the day, the project aims to identify the most dangerous times for road travel. This can inform traffic management strategies and public awareness campaigns.
   
## Predictive Modelling

#### The project employs machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, to predict accident severity based on various factors such as:
    •	Location (latitude and longitude)
  
    •	Time (hour, day of week, month)
  
    •	Weather conditions
  
    •	Road type
  
    •	Visibility
  
#### This predictive model can be used to:

    •	Assess the potential risk of accidents in specific conditions
  
    •	Guide resource allocation for emergency response planning
  
    •	Inform policy decisions related to road safety measures
  
#### Key Insights

The analysis provides valuable insights into traffic accident patterns, including:

    •	Identification of high-risk areas (accident hotspots)
  
    •	Peak hours for accident occurrence
  
    •	Factors contributing to accident severity
  
  
These insights can be used by traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers to develop targeted interventions and improve overall road safety. The project demonstrates the power of data science in addressing real-world problems, using a combination of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract actionable insights from traffic accident data.
